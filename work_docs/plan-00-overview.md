# Plan 00 — Master overview: truthful token accounting & trigger rework

**Date:** 2026-08-01
**Status:** Planning — no code changes yet
**Inputs:** `work_docs/issue-usage-based-token-counting.md` (evidence + direction), `work_docs/token-estimation-results.md` (calibration data), `work_docs/upstream-token-trigger-semantic-diff.md` (upstream fixes + semantic mapping)
**Constraint (from the author):** fix this **for once and for all** — rework/refactor, **no proliferation of new config fields**.

---

## 1. The problem, one paragraph

Every trigger in the pipeline compares a **chars/4 estimate** against a **static absolute threshold** that was calibrated for a ~128k world. The estimate underreports real provider usage by 20–39% median (up to 75× in windows), so: compaction effectively never fires before pi's hard limit (7.3–7.7× churn in the archive), observer/reflector/dropper fire late (98/77/109 LATE windows), the status panel disagrees with pi's footer, static thresholds waste 1M windows and overflow 64k workers, the observer chunk cap silently drops the *oldest* conversation when engaged, single oversized entries are sent whole and can still blow the worker window, and stream-level LLM failures are invisible in the debug log. Meanwhile the config surface keeps growing (upstream added 3 fields for their fixes alone).

## 2. North star — one number, everything derived

**The effective context window is the only number that matters. Every threshold and budget derives from it at runtime; absolute config values become optional overrides, not the primary mechanism.**

The codebase already gestures at this philosophy — `llms.txt` (L323–348) publishes sizing formulas (`compactAfterTokens = model_context × 0.65`, everything else as fractions of it) and README ships low/medium/high preset blocks. **Note:** those formulas are *guidance text for humans/LLMs picking values*, not what users actually run — users run either the built-in defaults or hand-picked absolute numbers. So the formulas are not authoritative provenance for derivation constants; the constants are anchored to the **698-session archive calibration** (`token-estimation-results.md`) and the README 60–70% compaction rule, and are finalized by re-running the analysis script in Phase 3 (see `plan-03` §7). The refactor still makes derivation the **runtime behavior** — that's what kills the config-field sprawl: instead of adding ratio-mode fields (upstream's `compactAfterTokensMode` + `compactAfterTokensRatio`), every existing threshold field gets a `0 = auto` sentinel (precedent already in the codebase: `observerPreambleMaxTokens: 0 = auto`).

## 3. Design decisions (the decision log)

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **D1** | **All real-usage counters derive from branch entries** (assistant `usage` + chars/4 trailing estimate). No `ctx.getContextUsage()` dependency for numerators. | Entries-only counters are pure functions: immune to our stale-ctx hazard (deferred setTimeout/async stages outlive the extension ctx — `isStaleExtensionContextError` exists precisely for this), testable, usable identically in triggers, stages, commands, and tests. pi's `getContextUsage().tokens` is computed from the same data anyway. |
| **D2** | **Compaction measures "real context now" vs `ratio × window`; coverage counters measure "usage delta since anchor".** | Compaction: pi rebuilds context after compacting, so the first valid assistant usage *after* the compaction point is the honest baseline — "context now" *is* "since compaction". Coverage markers are written mid-context (no reset), so only a **delta** (usage now − usage at anchor) is meaningful — naive reuse of the compaction counter would fire every turn (the issue doc's key insight, confirmed by upstream PR #40's `realTokensSinceAnchor`). |
| **D3** | **Usage anchors never use the compaction entry's own usage.** | That usage is the summary-generation call (pre-compaction scale, different LLM call) — upstream PR #40's hard-won rule. Baselines: last valid assistant usage **strictly after** the compaction entry (compaction), or **at/before** the coverage/cursor anchor index (coverage). Error/aborted assistant messages excluded; `ToolResultMessage.usage` never counts (pi: "not part of main LLM context accounting"). |
| **D4** | **Unmeasurable → fall back to chars/4, never clamp.** | No valid baseline (fresh session, right after compaction, error storm), negative delta (mid-session model/provider switch), or missing usage → fall back to the existing raw estimate. Clamping to 0 would starve a stage forever; measuring from 0 would re-fire every turn (upstream's exact reasoning). |
| **D5** | **Clean break, per field: an explicitly-set value is respected verbatim, forever; auto-derivation only fills fields the user never set (or set to `0`).** | The author's requirement #1. No global "mode" — a user can pin `observeAfterTokens` and leave everything else auto. Zero new fields for this mechanism: `0` previously meant "absent → default" for all positiveInt fields, so the sentinel is compatible. **The one unavoidable semantic shift:** explicit values are now compared against *real usage tokens*, not chars/4 estimates — the value is respected, the basis it counts on is the fix. Migration guidance: multiply custom trigger thresholds by ~1.45 or set `0`. (Treating legacy values as estimate-basis forever would preserve the bug for exactly the users who configured — rejected.) |
| **D6** | **Derivation constants:** compact `0.65 × sessionWindow`; observe `0.25 × sessionWindow`; reflect `0.40 × sessionWindow`; observer chunk `0.20 × workerWindow`; reflector/dropper input `0.60 × workerWindow`; pool max `0.15 × sessionWindow`, target = max/2. **Anchored to the archive calibration, not the llms.txt guidance formulas; finalized by script re-run in Phase 3.** | compact 0.65 = README 60–70% rule + tier calibration anchor. observe/reflect sit between cadence-preserving T' (23.6k/36.3k on 128k) and fire-40% calibration (67.9k/82.4k) — a documented, cost-conscious product choice. Chunk 0.20 = upstream PR #34's CJK-safe ratio (worst-case 4× undercount → ~80% window). Input caps 0.60 ≈ preserves today's 80k-on-128k. **Trigger thresholds are usage-basis; chunk/input/pool budgets are estimate-basis** (outbound text has never been through the LLM — no usage exists; upstream PR #40's out-of-scope reasoning). |
| **D7** | **Worker-window upper bound on every worker trigger** (the issue doc's upper-bound invariant): a worker is due when `progress >= min(resolvedThreshold, workerWindow − AGENT_LOOP_RESERVE − overhead)`. | A 1M session model with a 64k observer must fire *before* the backlog overflows the worker — otherwise perpetual skip → cooldown churn → backlog grows forever. The trigger uses the best synchronously-available worker window; the existing in-stage `context_window_exceeded` pre-check remains the authoritative guard. |
| **D8** | **Chunk cap rewrite to upstream's serializer-budget semantics**: oldest-first, honest budget (labels + separators), marked head/tail excerpt for a single oversized entry, coverage advances only through ids the serializer actually returned. | Our `capSourceEntriesToTokens` keeps **newest** entries — the oldest uncovered conversation is silently, permanently skipped (data loss), and a single oversized entry is sent whole (the exact 1.7M-char failure upstream shipped in v1 and fixed). Budgeting belongs in the serializer because that's the only place that measures the actual text sent. |
| **D9** | **Stream-error visibility**: port upstream PR #33's `logAgentStreamError` into all three agent drain loops + surface into `runtime.lastObserverError`/`lastReflectorError`/`lastDropperError` (fields exist). | The #32 failure mode (383 swallowed calls) is invisible to us too: our `observer.error` events only catch *thrown* exceptions; `stopReason: "error"/"aborted"` messages are silently drained today. |
| **D10** | **Ship counting change + auto-derivation atomically, with a one-time breaking-change warning** (`lastSeenVersion` state + `BREAKING_SINCE` constant, pattern from `cooldown.ts`). | The install base is fire-and-forget with mostly **paid** API keys; unchanged absolute thresholds under truthful counting = 1.3–1.7× more worker calls (real spend). Auto-derivation keeps default users at roughly constant-or-lower frequency; override users get the warning + migration note. |
| **D11** | **Presets move into the config modal; static preset blocks in docs retire.** | README/llms.txt absolute preset blocks are estimate-era numbers and retire into override guidance. The author's direction: a **Presets tab** in the configure modal — one click, save global/project via the existing scope actions. With auto-derivation, presets become **posture profiles** (see D14) rather than absolute blocks; the tab can also offer recalibrated absolute blocks for users who want exact pins (Phase 4). |
| **D12** | **Line-based observation token accounting** (`observationLineTokenCount`) for stored `tokenCount` and all pool sums. | Pool budgets cap what gets re-rendered into future contexts — the full `[id] ts [rel] content` line is the real footprint. Our `buildExistingObservationsSummary` already counts full lines while pools count bare content — an existing internal inconsistency, fixed once. |
| **D13** | **Worker Safety Invariant (explicit, named, tested):** *a worker of window W never receives more than f(W) estimated tokens per run, and its trigger always fires before the backlog exceeds W — regardless of session-model window.* Three enforcement layers: (a) **content trimming** in the observer-bound serializer (tool results/thinking — promoted from deferred; see plan-02 §4.5), (b) **chunk budget** `0.20 × W` with oldest-first + excerpt (plan-02), (c) **trigger upper bound** `min(threshold, W − reserve)` (D7). | The author's real-world scenario: **1M session model with ~128k worker models** — the pipeline must keep churning observations/reflections through the small workers without overflowing. Important correction surfaced while planning: chunk-content trimming does **not** exist today — `truncateRecordContent` (10k chars) only truncates what agents *write* (their own records); pi's own tool-output truncation happens at capture time but lets giants through (the 1.7M-char case). The invariant makes the guarantee explicit and testable instead of assumed. |
| **D14** | **`thresholdScale` — the ONE new config field** (default `1.0`, finite > 0, clamped [0.1, 10]). Multiplies the three **auto-derived** trigger thresholds (observe/reflect/compact). Ignored for fields with explicit absolute values (clean break, D5). | The single meaningful cost dial that auto-derivation unlocks — and the direct answer to the paid-user-base concern: fire-and-forget users never see it; cost-sensitive users set `0.6` instead of hand-tuning 8 fields; heavy users set `1.5`. Also the substrate for the modal posture presets (D11): "Cost-saver" = `0.6`, "Responsive" = `1.5`. Estimate-basis budgets (chunk/input/pool) are safety-derived from windows and are NOT scaled. |

**One measurement core, one threshold resolver, one due function per stage.** Today the trigger check (`anyStageDue`), the stage re-check (`runObserverStage` etc.), and the status display (`memory.ts`) each compute progress independently — that drift class dies.

## 5. Config surface — before → after (ONE new field, total)

| Field | Today (default) | After (default) | Basis | Meaning of `>0` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `compactAfterTokens` | 81000 | **0 = auto** (0.65 × session window) | real context now | absolute real-context trigger |
| `observeAfterTokens` | 15000 | **0 = auto** (0.25 × session window) | usage delta | absolute usage-delta trigger |
| `reflectAfterTokens` | 25000 | **0 = auto** (0.40 × session window) | usage delta | absolute usage-delta trigger |
| `observerChunkMaxTokens` | 40000 | **0 = auto** (0.20 × worker window, min 256) | estimate (outbound) | absolute chunk cap |
| `reflectorInputMaxTokens` | 80000 | **0 = auto** (0.60 × worker window) | estimate (outbound) | absolute input cap |
| `dropperInputMaxTokens` | 80000 | **0 = auto** (0.60 × worker window) | estimate (outbound) | absolute input cap |
| `observationsPoolMaxTokens` | 20000 | **0 = auto** (0.15 × session window) | line-based estimate | absolute pool cap |
| `observationsPoolTargetTokens` | 10000 | **0 = auto** (pool max / 2) | line-based estimate | absolute pool target |
| `observerPreambleMaxTokens` | 0 = auto (30% chunk) | unchanged | estimate | unchanged |
| **`thresholdScale`** | — (absent) | **1.0 (new field — the only one)** | multiplier | scales auto-derived trigger thresholds only; ignored for explicit values (D14) |

Unchanged/internal: `agentMaxTurns`, `dropperPressureThreshold`, `dropperPoolFullnessThreshold`, model configs, fallback chains, legacy keys.

**Migration:** existing explicit values are honored verbatim as absolutes (D5's clean break, per field). Trigger fields change basis (estimate → usage): docs advise multiplying custom trigger thresholds by ~1.45, switching to `0` (auto), or dialing `thresholdScale`. One-time warning (D10) tells users this in-product.

## 6. Phase index

| Phase | Doc | Contents | Behavior change? | Verification gate |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Measurement core** | `plan-01-measurement-core.md` | usage helpers, real counters, basis tags, window resolver | **None** (add-only; nothing calls the new code) | new unit tests + full suite green |
| **2 — Chunk integrity & failure visibility** | `plan-02-chunk-integrity.md` | **content trimming (tool results/thinking),** serializer budget rewrite, cap replacement, excerpt, stream-error logging | Yes — worker-safety invariant lands; fixes silent data loss; new debug events | new unit/integration tests + full suite + smoke |
| **3 — Truthful triggers & auto-derivation** | `plan-03-truthful-triggers.md` | unified due-computation, real numerators, 0=auto config, threshold resolver, upper-bound invariant, breaking-change warning, constants finalized via script | Yes — the big one | unit + integration + archive-script before/after + live soak checklist |
| **4 — Consistency, display & docs** | `plan-04-consistency-display.md` | line-based pool accounting, status basis tags, resolved thresholds in UI, **Presets tab in the config modal,** README/CONFIG/llms.txt rewrite, migration guide | Minor (display + accounting + UX) | tests + docs review |
| **Gate 1 — pre-merge replay** | `plan-06-release-gates.md` | "what-if" harness: real new code replayed over the 698 existing session JSONLs with example configs | — | **explicit pass criteria G1.1–G1.7** |
| **Gate 2 — live soak & breakpoint analysis** | `plan-06-release-gates.md` | branch build in daily-driver for days; new sessions + debug logs analyzed from artifacts | — | **explicit pass criteria G2.1–G2.8** |
| **5 — Deferred register** | `plan-05-deferred.md` | circuit breaker, upstream watch, dropper gating tuning, comms, pi API watch | — | reviewed each release |

**Ordering rationale:** Phase 1 builds primitives with zero behavior change (safe to land anytime). Phase 2 fixes correctness bugs (silent data loss, invisible failures) and lands the Worker Safety Invariant — independent of counting basis, upstream-validated. Phase 3 flips the counting basis on top of Phase 1's primitives and Phase 2's honest chunk sizes. **Gate 1 then proves the branch against the real session archive before merge; Gate 2 proves it in real daily usage from artifacts (new sessions + debug logs), not anecdote.** Phase 4 (display/docs/presets tab) can land before or after Gate 1, but must be in before release. Each phase is independently shippable and revertable; the gates are hard stops with failure routing (plan-06 §8).

## 7. Worked scenarios (the real-world configurations)

**A. Small local models (32k–128k), minimal setup, zero config.** All fields `0` → auto: compact at 0.65×W, observe 0.25×W, reflect 0.40×W. Worker Safety Invariant (D13) keeps every worker input ≤ 0.2×W chunk of trimmed content. Behavior ≈ today's low/medium defaults, but follows the actual model instead of a stale preset.

**B. 1M session model + ~128k workers (the author's flagged case).** Auto thresholds: observe `0.25×1M = 250k`, reflect `400k`, compact `650k` (usage basis) — "when a run is worthwhile" on the session's scale. The **upper bound** (D7) clamps firing to worker ingestibility (~115k accumulated for a 128k worker), so the observer fires **before** the backlog could overflow the worker. Each run ingests ≤ `0.2×128k ≈ 25.6k` estimated tokens of **trimmed** content (tool results/thinking head+tail), oldest-first, with a marked excerpt for any single giant entry — coverage advances every run, the backlog drains across runs, nothing is silently dropped, and `stopReason: "error"` failures are logged. The small worker keeps churning; the large session's progress can never swamp it.

**C. Author's explicit config (observe 25k / reflect+drop 80k / compact 185k).** Respected **verbatim** (D5) — now compared against real usage tokens, so cadence rises ~1.3–1.7× (the truthful-counting effect). Options documented: multiply by ~1.45 (25k→36k, 80k→116k, 185k→260k), or set `0` for auto, or keep and add `thresholdScale` later. The breaking-change warning (D10) says exactly this in-product, once.

**D. Mixed/partial config.** User pins only `compactAfterTokens: 300000`: compaction fires at 300k real tokens (absolute), observe/reflect auto-derive, `thresholdScale` (if set) applies only to the auto ones. Per-field clean break.

## 8. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Paid-user spend increase from truthful counting | Medium | Auto-derivation constants chosen between cadence-preserving and fire-40% targets; atomic ship; breaking-change warning; migration docs (×1.45 rule) |
| Usage data absent (some providers) | Medium | chars/4 fallback everywhere (D4); those sessions keep old behavior |
| Post-compaction immediate re-trigger (stale pre-compaction usage) | Medium | D3's strictly-after-compaction scan; unmeasurable → fallback (D4); tests |
| Mid-session model switch → negative delta | Low | D4 fallback; test |
| Auto-derivation on unknown/small windows | Medium | 128k floor in window resolution; worker-window upper bound (D7) keeps small workers ingestible |
| Cursor/`not_due` advance suppresses re-checks under fallback | Low | Fallback path must not advance cursors on unmeasurable baselines (Phase 3 spec, test) |
| Excerpt hurts observer quality on giant tool results | Low | Excerpt is marked; source stays recallable; only affects entries that could never be ingested anyway |
| Breaking change reaches fire-and-forget users silently | Medium | D10 warning + CONFIG.md/README/llms.txt migration notes + CHANGELOG |
| Scope creep (trimming, presets tab) | — | Phase 5 deferred register; nothing enters without explicit decision |

## 9. Non-goals (this plan)

- Changing pi's own compaction behavior or footer (host-side).
- Observer/reflector/dropper prompt changes.
- Manual-mode / pending.json architecture changes (only anchor mapping where needed).
- More than the ONE new config field (`thresholdScale`, D14). Future issues get resolved by derivation and invariants, not by new "max tokens for XYZ" knobs — this is the maintenance contract.
- Circuit breaker (Phase 5).
- Upstream ratio-mode *config fields* — deliberately rejected in favor of D5's 0=auto (no new fields).
